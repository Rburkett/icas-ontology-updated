# icas-ontology

## Goals

This repository contains the unified ICAS ontology designed to
describe information-security related information.

This document describes the structure of the repository and the
collaboration process.

## Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119.

## Collaboration Process

The process for collaborating on the unified ontology generally
follows the [C4.1 Collective Code Construction
Contract](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22), except for the
Licensing and Ownership section. The key concepts are outlined
below.

### Permissions

There are two teams configured for the icas-ontology repository:

+ Ontology Collaboration
    + Members of this team have READ access to the repository,
      which means that they can clone, create issues, create
      forks, and generate pull requests. Most collaborators on
      the unified ontology will belong to this team.
+ Ontology Maintainers
    + Members of this team have READ/WRITE access to the
      repository, which means that they can merge pull requests.

### Suggesting Changes to the Ontology

To suggest a change to the unified ontology, collaborators should
do the following:

1. Fork invincealabs/icas-ontology on GitHub.com.
2. Make any changes in the forked repository
3. Create a pull request to merge changes back to the master
   branch of invincealabs/icas-ontology

A member of the Ontology Maintainers team should review and then
merge the pull request, or initiate a discussion if appropriate.

### Discussions

Insofar as practical, all discussions about changes to the
ontology should occur on Github in pull requests or issues,
thereby providing a record of that discussion alongside the
change itself.
